# Face_recognition
  - This is a repository of face recognition algorithms used in 🏫school-specific outsourcing and graduation production.</br>
  - The haarcascade_frontalface filter used here is customized for certain functions on top of the Raspberry Pi environment, and can be modified to suit your request.</br></br>
The development is currently 🖐over and will be updated using C# later on top of Ubuntu environment.</br>
If you have any questions about development, 🙏don't hesitate to contact me.


1. Part1 is a source that takes pictures and stores them in the desired path. If you want to do face recognition, start with part one.</br>
2. Part2 is just a debug code to test the algorithm in part3, so you can skip it.
3. After performing part1, if you modify the path in part 3 as you want, the computer will recognize your face on its own.
